In this exercise, we start changing the fields for temperature and precipitation that you made to see how the SMB responds. Change them in at least two ways to represent different climate changes, e.g., warmer everywhere, more precipitation and warmer, changes in seasonality, etc. You can also test the effect of elevation desertification or similar processes if you like.

One of these different climates should represent a glacial climate (colder, dryer). It is important that you document the results in a pdf with explanations of what you found. Do not just send your python code but include maps of SMB, for example. You can also integrate the SMB over the entire domain and show the three (or more) different climate states next to each other as a bar plot.

### Notes:
Let's do a 1) glacial climate and 2) reduce seasonality.

### ToDo:
- [ ] can namelist be read without copying model?
- [ ] not copy-pasting mean surface mass balance
