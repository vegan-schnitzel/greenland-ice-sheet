% Please write an individual report about the field work at Folgefonna of about 2000 words. Since we did not spend a lot of time in the field and have limited data, the focus should be the process of data retrieval, how to prepare and log measurements, dealing with the imperfections of field work, and a discussion of how these challenges affect data quality.
