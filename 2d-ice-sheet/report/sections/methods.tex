\section{Methodology}

% Method and data collection (How to prepare a measurement? How do we ensure the best possible quality? How do we keep track of data?)

Probably I'm going to explain the method theoretically and then add details about the actual data acquisition.

\subsection{Remote Sensing}

\begin{itemize}
	\item UAV Footage: capture single frames to obtain 3D model of glacier
	\item data missing
	\item metadata from logbook
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ice Cores}

\begin{itemize}
	\item drill with extension sticks, obtain vertical temperature profile (x2, \textbf{Tinytags}) and density measurements (one in snow pit \textbf{AXEL} \& one in borehole \textbf{INES})
	\item In total, we did three boreholes \#1, \#2, \#3.
	\item metadata from logbook
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ground Penetrating Radar}

\begin{itemize}
	\item structures in ground reflect radar -> bedrock/frozen layers topography
	\item MALAGS data
\end{itemize}
