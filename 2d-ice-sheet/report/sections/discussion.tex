\section{Discussion}

% A good report will link the field measurements with what we learned in class and, if possible, published literature. A few guiding questions could be 'Do the observations show what we expected?', 'What could explain a possible disagreement?', and 'If we had more time, how could that improve our data?'. A critical discussion of the shortcomings and advantages of the methodology is also important. 

% Discussion and conclusion (Is the data any good? What could be improved? What would the data look like if we had taken it at a different time of year or at a different elevation?)

% Discussion is the most important part of your report, because here, you show that you understand the experiment beyond the simple level of completing it.
